      <p>Hi! This is a kitchen tracking app that lets you enter your ingredients and search recipes you can make with them.</p>

      <p>I recommend you sign up for the best experienceâ€”that'll let you save recipes to your profile for later.</p>

      <p>If you're just looking to figure out tonight (as I was when I built this app), feel free to go ahead with the simple search here.</p>
