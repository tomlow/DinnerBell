# DinnerBell

Let's get cooking.

## Overview

<b>DinnerBell</b> is a web application that solves the problem of not knowing what to cook. It allows a user to enter the ingredients in their pantry and see a list of recommended recipes. They can save recipes they like to their profile for later, where they will appear in different color gradients depending on whether the user has the right ingredients or not. Additionally, each recipe's show page will display summary information, required ingredients, missing ingredients if any, and instructions for cooking.

## In-Depth Structure

DinnerBell uses the Spoonacular API and robust data normalization and massaging to ensure that relevant and complete results are returned to the user. A modular React front end manages complex state and props to dynamically update the UI with the returned data as the user interacts with the site. Ant design components, the React Async library, and custom Sass styling with a Foundation base ensure that these interactions are smooth and intuitive.

Finally, a postgreSQL relational database structure stores user data and use of the Objection ORM and Knex query builder library make interacting with the database fast and easily customized.

This application also uses S3 image storage, session storage, and end-to-end Cypress testing.

Watch a demo of the site [here](), or visit the heroku page and try it yourself!
